## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my **first Machine Learning project**! 🚀

The goal of this project was to build a regression model that predicts median housing prices in California districts. As a beginner in Data Science, I focused on understanding the core workflow of an ML project: exploring data, handling missing values, and training a **Random Forest Regressor** to make predictions.

This project serves as a foundational step in my journey toward mastering Data Science and Analytics.

## 📂 The Dataset
I used the standard **California Housing Dataset** (based on the 1990 California Census).
* **Rows:** ~20,640
* **Features:** 10 (including `Longitude`, `Latitude`, `MedianIncome`, `TotalRooms`, etc.)
* **Target Variable:** `MedianHouseValue`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data correlations and distributions.
* **Scikit-Learn:** For splitting data, training the model, and evaluating performance.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
Since this was my first project, I followed a structured standard pipeline:
1.  **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using Pandas.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized correlations (e.g., seeing how *Median Income* affects *House Prices*).
4.  **Model Training:** Used a **Random Forest Regressor**, which is robust and handles non-linear data well.
5.  **Evaluation:** Tested the model on unseen data to check its accuracy.

## 📊 Model Performance
I evaluated the model using **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) ~ 18K which indicates that features contain strong predictive signals and that non-linear relationships matter.

* **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor
* **Performance:** The model successfully captures the general trend of housing prices, though there is room for optimization as I learn more about Hyperparameter Tuning.
