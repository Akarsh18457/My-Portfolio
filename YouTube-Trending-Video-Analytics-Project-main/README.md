## 📌 Executive Summary
**The Goal:** In the crowded digital landscape, content creators struggle to understand what makes a video go viral. [cite_start]This project analyzes a dataset of YouTube Trending Videos to identify the key success factors driving viewership[cite: 34, 36].
[cite_start]**The Approach:** Leveraging **Python** for data processing and **Tableau** for visualization, I explored relationships between video categories, engagement metrics (views/likes), and audience sentiment[cite: 38, 48].
[cite_start]**The Insight:** The analysis revealed that while **Music and Gaming** are top-tier categories, videos with a **"Neutral" sentiment** surprisingly dominate the trending page, challenging the assumption that only highly emotional content goes viral.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Data Processing:** Python, Pandas, NumPy [cite: 43, 44]
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau (Dashboards) [cite: 45, 46, 48]
* [cite_start]**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook [cite: 47]
* [cite_start]**Data Source:** Public Kaggle dataset of trending videos from multiple countries[cite: 52].

## 📊 Key Findings (EDA)
> *Relationship between Views and Likes shows a strong positive correlation.*

**1. The "Neutral" Advantage**
[cite_start]Contrary to the belief that clickbait or extreme emotion drives clicks, my sentiment analysis showed that **Neutral-toned content** appears most frequently on the Trending page. This suggests that informative and balanced content has high algorithm favorability.

**2. Top Performing Categories**
The data confirms that the highest average viewership is consistently found in:
* [cite_start]**Science & Technology** 
* [cite_start]**Music** 
* [cite_start]**Gaming** 

**3. Engagement Correlation**
[cite_start]A scatter plot analysis confirmed a **strong positive correlation** between View Count and Likes[cite: 39, 62]. This metric is a more reliable predictor of trending status than comment count alone.

## 📈 Methodology
[cite_start]The project followed a structured data lifecycle[cite: 50]:
1.  [cite_start]**Data Acquisition:** Aggregated raw datasets of trending videos from varying regions[cite: 52].
2.  [cite_start]**Cleaning & Prep:** Used Pandas to handle missing values and structure the data for analysis[cite: 53].
3.  [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Calculated average metrics per category and analyzed sentiment distribution[cite: 57, 59].
4.  [cite_start]**Visualization:** Created bar charts for category ranking and scatter plots for engagement correlation using Matplotlib/Seaborn[cite: 61, 62].
5.  [cite_start]**Dashboarding:** Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to allow users to filter trends by country and category.
