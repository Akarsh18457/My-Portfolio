## 📌 Executive Summary
**The Goal:** In the crowded digital landscape, content creators struggle to understand what makes a video go viral. This project analyzes a dataset of YouTube Trending Videos to identify the key success factors driving viewership.
**The Approach:** Leveraging **Python** for data processing and **Tableau** for visualization, I explored relationships between video categories, engagement metrics (views/likes), and audience sentiment.
**The Insight:** The analysis revealed that while **Music and Gaming** are top-tier categories, videos with a **"Neutral" sentiment** surprisingly dominate the trending page, challenging the assumption that only highly emotional content goes viral.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*]**Data Processing:** Python, Pandas, NumPy 
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau (Dashboards) 
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 
* **Data Source:** Public Kaggle dataset of trending videos from multiple countries.

## 📊 Key Findings (EDA)
> *Relationship between Views and Likes shows a strong positive correlation.*

**1. The "Neutral" Advantage**
Contrary to the belief that clickbait or extreme emotion drives clicks, my sentiment analysis showed that **Neutral-toned content** appears most frequently on the Trending page. This suggests that informative and balanced content has high algorithm favorability.

**2. Top Performing Categories**
The data confirms that the highest average viewership is consistently found in:
* **Science & Technology** 
* **Music** 
* **Gaming** 

**3. Engagement Correlation**
A scatter plot analysis confirmed a **strong positive correlation** between View Count and Likes. This metric is a more reliable predictor of trending status than comment count alone.

## 📈 Methodology
The project followed a structured data lifecycle:
1.  **Data Acquisition:** Aggregated raw datasets of trending videos from varying regions.
2.  **Cleaning & Prep:** Used Pandas to handle missing values and structure the data for analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Calculated average metrics per category and analyzed sentiment distribution.
4   **Visualization:** Created bar charts for category ranking and scatter plots for engagement correlation using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
5.  **Dashboarding:** Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to allow users to filter trends by country and category.
