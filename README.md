# Bank Customer Churn Prediction & Risk Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a commercial bank using Machine Learning. Beyond prediction, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to translate model outputs into actionable business strategies. The analysis identifies high-value customers at risk and recommends retention measures.

**Key Metrics:**
* **Total Customers Analyzed:** 2,000 (Test Set)
* **Identified At-Risk Capital:** ~€22.45 Million (Sum of 'Balance' for predicted churners)
* **Primary Churn Driver:** Age and Inactive Status

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering
* **Machine Learning:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Tableau:** Interactive Business Intelligence Dashboard
* **Pandas/NumPy:** Data Manipulation

### Key Findings:
1.  **Demographics:** Older customers (40-60 age group) are significantly more likely to churn.
2.  **Geography:** 'Germany' has the highest churn rate and should be a priority for regional retention campaigns.
3.  **Financials:** High-balance customers are leaving at a higher rate than low-balance customers, posing a severe revenue risk.
